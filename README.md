# Directory Challenge

### Task
To build a simple ~~image~~ cat gif storage system.

Some interfaces were provided in the `/src` directory. The solution
should implement each of these and provide usage examples which may be run
from the command line.

The solution should demonstrate manipulation of the filesystem using the 
images provided in the `/images` directory.


### Tests
I have added unit tests for the File and Directory classes. 

To run tests, run the following commands:

```
composer install

./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Usage Examples
The below examples have been run using PsySH REPL.
![Alt test](/images/Image1.png?raw=true "Image 1")
![Alt test](/images/Image2.png?raw=true "Image 2")
